We seek a **full-time, benefits-eligible manager/technician** to provide lab-based research support for our group's projects on the ecological processes that maintain species diversity in microbial food webs. The ideal start date is **May-June 2021**. The initial appointment will be for 1 year, though funding is available for multi-year extensions.

This position is ideally suited for recent Bachelors or Masters students. In addition to the core lab support duties, there will be ample support for professional growth through advanced training, intellectual engagement with the group, and co-authorship of peer-reviewed papers. We are a lab committed to a building a diverse, equitable, & inclusive science. As such, we especially invite applications from individuals who identify with marginalized and underrepresented groups.

### Qualifications
#### Minimum:
- Bachelor's degree in biology or a related field **with lab-based coursework or research experience encompassing**:
  + aseptic technique for culturing microbes
  + basic light microscopy
  + maintenance of a lab notebook
- excellent organization & verbal/written communication skills
- ability to work independently, prioritizing day-to-day tasks to meet defined research objectives
- basic proficiency in data management (e.g., entry, error checking, meta-data documentation)
- valid drivers license & ability to drive state-owned vehicles to complete work tasks
#### Preferred:
- Masters degree or relevant work experience in microbiology or a related field
- prior lab work experience with protists and/or bacteria
- basic proficiency with version control systems (e.g., git/GitHub)
- laboratory experience with DNA extraction & preparation for sequencing
- curiosity about population-, community-, and ecosystem-level processes

### Essential job duties & technical knowledge:
This position's primary duties are to provide lab-based research support for our group's projects that focus on the mechanisms that maintain species diversity in microbial communities.
#### A typical week may include:
- Meeting with supervisor to establish research goals/priorities & to review progress during the previous week
- Tasks to maintain lab organization, upkeep, & safety
- Maintenance of protist & bacterial cultures
- Inventory management (including placing orders through the university purchasing system)
- Experiment set-up (including optimization of protocols)
- Data collection & entry
- Schedule management for shared facilities & equipment
- Assigning tasks to undergraduate students working in the lab
- Reading papers related to our group's research & participation in the group lab meeting

#### Occasional duties may include:
- Assistance with setting up & troubleshooting equipment, software, & work-flows
- Training new users on lab equipment, experimental protocols, & data entry
- Basic upkeep of the lab vehicle (e.g., dropoff/pickup from on-campus vehicle maintenance, refueling)
- Assistance with plant or microbial experiments in the Phytotron or at local field sites

Although this position is largely lab-based on NCSU's main campus, there may be opportunities for work travel to assist with field work  (including Michigan, Colorado, or California). Because these trips are outside the scope of this position's main duties, they will only be assigned upon mutual agreement.

The successful applicant will be expected to complete required safety training provided through NCSU-EHS upon employment and maintain safety compliance throughout their time in the lab.

### Compensation
This is a full-time (40 h/wk) position, paid at a competitive hourly rate commensurate with experience. Compensation also includes the standard benefits package offered to NCSU employees, which **includes employer contributions to health insurance.** Additional benefit information is available through NCSU's Human Resources and is subject to policies at the time of employment. Currently, these include paid state holidays, vacation+sick leave, and discounted access to campus recreation facilities, events, and childcare.

As part of our lab's commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion, we're open to exploring mutually-agreeable work schedules that deviate from the rigid "9-to-5" model.

### About the Lab, Department, and Raleigh
We are a newly establishing lab. Over the course of this position, we'll be laying the foundation for an entire research program. This means lots of opportunities to work closely with the group leader and do the creative on-the-fly work to solve problems. This type of work is challenging, but offers experience and rewards that are harder to come by in more established labs.

The Department of Plant & Microbial Biology is one of several biology-related departments on campus. The faculty work on a wide range of exciting questions in an equally wide range of study systems. Its a truly engaging, interactive, and exciting place to do science.

Raleigh joins the nearby cities Durham and Chapel Hill to form the 'Research Triangle,' an internationally-known hub for the biosciences. These cities collectively punch above their weight in terms of cosmopolitan cultural opportunities (think great food, music scene, & events, much of it walkable from campus). But unlike a single city of their collective size, it's much easier to escape to nature. Both the Smokey Mountains and Atlantic Ocean beaches are within range for a weekend trip. For journeys farther afield, rail the Triangle sits in the heart of Amtrak's East Coast lines and has a surprisingly well-connected airport.
