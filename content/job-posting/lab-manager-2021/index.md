The Diversity in Changing Environments Lab seeks a **full-time (40h/week) Research Specialist (Position #: 00109009) to support the research and administrative activities of our group beginning in February 2022**. We study the ecological mechanisms that maintain biodiversity through a combination of lab/field experiments and mathematical modeling. Towards this goal, we are using the microbial food webs associated with the pitcher plant Sarracenia purpurea as a model for understanding how changing environmental conditions affect individual species’ demography and reshuffle species interactions (competition, consumption, and facilitation) to affect the diversity, stability, and function of food webs.

We are looking for a highly motivated & organized individual to support our group’s research projects. The successful candidate must be able to work independently to coordinate progress among a diverse range of tasks towards assigned goals, and to maintain effective collaboration with other team members. **Application review will begin on 13 January 2022** and continue until the position is filled.

The primary responsibility of the Research Specialist will be to support our group’s research projects on microbial communities. The successful candidate will work independently to coordinate progress among a diverse range of tasks towards assigned goals/experiments, assist in maintaining the lab’s day-to-day operation, and maintain effective collaboration with other team members.

**At present, this position is time-limited for two (2) years, with possible renewal based on funding.**

## Occasional duties:
Although this position is primarily lab-based, occasional assistance with greenhouse & NC-based field work may be required (e.g., setting up experiments, collecting data or samples). The Research Specialist will also occasionally support our group’s education and outreach efforts. We welcome individuals who want to engage in additional scholarly activities of our lab group, including participation in lab meetings, contribution to the design of experiments, or assistance with data analysis and manuscript preparation. With supervisor’s agreement, primary job duties and timelines will be adjusted to accommodate participation in scholarly activities.

## Required training & experience:
-	Bachelor’s degree in biology, ecology, microbiology, or a related field (preferably including a lab-based course in microbiology)
-	At least 1 year of related research experience (an equivalent combination of transferable training & skills may be substituted)

## Required skills:
-	General lab microbiology skills (sterile technique, isolations, inoculations, media preparation, culture transfers, safety)
-	General microscopy use (stereo & compound)
-	Understanding of foundational ecological processes & terminology
-	(preferred) Familiarity with data management best practices for reproducible research
-	(preferred) ability to write/adapt code (e.g., in R, Python, MatLab, Julia)
-	(preferred) familiarity with version control workflows (e.g., Git, GitHub)
-	Valid NC Driver’s License or the ability to obtain one within 60 days of hire.

## Compensation:
The starting salary range is expected to be $42,000-45,000, depending on experience. Additionally, the Research Specialist will be eligible for  a generous benefits package that includes the State Health Plan, time off (University holidays, paid vacation, sick leave), a retirement plan, and several other benefits (see https://jobs.hr.ncsu.edu/benefits-and-perks/).
