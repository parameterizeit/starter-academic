We work at the interface of experiments, mathematical models, and theory to answer questions about the maintenance of species diversity, ecological forecasting, and population dynamics. Our work encompasses a broad range of study systems and methodological approaches, all anchored by the common goal of understanding the biodiversity in changing environments. If these topics inspire you too, we hope you'll consider joining us. We especially welcome applicants from marginalized and excluded groups as we work to transform ecology into a more equitable and inclusive science.

### Graduate students {#gradstudents}

Prospective graduate students who want to do ecological research on questions related to biodiversity in changing environments should [email Dr. Petry](https://parameterizeit.github.io/#contact) in the late summer or early fall with the following pieces of information:

1. A short paragraph describing the **ecological concepts, processes, and/or questions** that you want to pursue in your graduate research. No one is expected to have a fully-fledged research proposal at this stage, but being as specific as you can helps to demonstrate your preparedness for graduate research. Be sure to specifically address why our lab is well-suited to support your research interests, especially if you are interested in questions/approaches outside of our [past research](https://parameterizeit.github.io/#publications). If your research ideas would best be supported via a co-advising arrangement, please say so and identify the other lab(s) at NCSU that you are considering.
2. A short paragraph outlining your **motivation and preparedness** for pursuing graduate study. How will a graduate degree help you achieve your career goals? What previous study/experiences have prepared you for grad school?[^1]
3. Your current CV (see advice [here](https://wordvice.com/how-to-write-a-flawless-cv-curriculum-vitae-for-graduate-school/) and [here](https://www.prepscholar.com/gre/blog/how-to-write-a-cv-for-graduate-school/)).

Our Department offers two programs for graduate students, each of which has a Masters and Ph.D. track: [Plant Biology](https://cals.ncsu.edu/plant-and-microbial-biology/students/graduate/pb-grad-homepage/) and [Microbiology](https://cals.ncsu.edu/plant-and-microbial-biology/students/graduate/mb-grad-programs/). Both have Winter application deadlines for admission in the coming Fall. Neither program requires GRE scores, and I do not use them when evaluating prospective students. Students may also be admitted through [any other graduate program at NCSU](https://grad.ncsu.edu/programs/), although there may be additional logistical hurdles.

Applying to graduate programs is *very* different from applying to undergraduate programs. These differences are especially strong in ecology & evolutionary biology in the USA, where student usually apply to a particular adviser's lab (vs. general admission into a school/degree program). This usually means that prospective students need to contact potential advisers prior to formally applying to discuss research interest overlap and ensure that the adviser is able to accept students. Understanding the process is key component of a successful application, and the following resources offer a good starting place:

- [How-to guide](https://www.mordecailab.com/blog/applying-for-grad-school) compiled by Erin Mordecai's lab.
- [A high-level overview of the application process](https://ssecommunityblog.org/applying-to-a-phd-program-in-the-us-as-an-international-student/). This piece does a nice job plainly stating the 'assumed knowledge' of the US system from the perspective of an international student (but useful/relevant to all).
- [NCSU's resources](https://grad.ncsu.edu/students/international-students/) for international applicants & graduate students.

[^1]: Changing fields? A record of ecology-focused study and research experience can help, but isn't necessary. Many great ecologists started off in completely different disciplines. Just be sure to explain why you want to study ecology, and think creatively about how the skills you've gained in your discipline can transfer or give you unique insight into ecological processes.

### Postdocs {#postdocs}

Prospective postdocs should have a relevant research background, demonstrated publication record, and clear motivation for why they'd like to join the lab. There are three mechanisms through which this can happen:

- **Advertised positions:** these are usually funded through an *existing* grant and will be announced broadly via ECOLOG, Twitter, and similar venues ([why we advertise](https://www.chronicle.com/article/how-the-opaque-way-we-hire-postdocs-contributes-to-sciences-diversity-problem/))
- **Fellowships:** these are initiated by the prospective postdoc, based on a collaboratively-developed application to a specific fellowship competition (several lists of eco/evo postdoc fellowships are available, e.g., [here](http://biologypostdocs.weebly.com/north-america.html), [here](http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/baskett/links/academia.html#Postdoc), &  [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cHkWrbvNrRdhJL9Z8ucgBZ2HSts2GPA_yozbQPl_x_8/edit#gid=0))
- **Grants** *(atypical)***:** these are the same federally-funded research grants with support for a postdoc position as the advertised position, but are written collaboratively with the postdoc that would fill the position

We're especially keen to have postdocs join the group whose expertise *complements* ours, enabling us to collaboratively answer new questions that neither of us could have done alone. We view complementarity broadly--inclusive of bridges between (sub)disciplines, between fundamental and applied ecology, and between academia and industry/government/NGOs.

For advertised positions, specific application instructions will be included in the post. Postdoctoral candidates interested in seeking their own fellowship funding should [email me](#contact) well in advance of the application deadline with (*i*) a brief summary of their research background and interests, (*ii*) a 'pitch' of their project idea, and (*iii*) a CV.

### Undergraduate students {#undergrads}

Participating in undergraduate research is an unparalleled way to engage in the scientific discovery process and explore the possibility of a career in research. We anticipate regular openings **during the academic year** to assist with research projects for course credit, fulfillment of a degree requirement, work study, or pay ([more here](https://undergradresearch.dasa.ncsu.edu/getting-started/)). Interested undergraduates should [email me](#contact) with a paragraph outlining their motivation and preparedness for research (e.g., relevant coursework or previous research experience).

We also may have opportunities **during the summer** to engage in field research in the [Rocky Mountains](https://www.rmbl.org/students/undergraduates-beyond/summer-education-programreu/) and in [northern Michigan](https://lsa.umich.edu/umbs/students.html). These include educational programs for course credit, fully-funded & paid independent research through the NSF-REU program, and seasonal technician jobs (see below). Interested students may contact me at anytime to discuss these opportunities, but should do so **no later than January 15th** if applying for an NSF-REU (application deadlines are usually in February).

### Seasonal field technicians {#fieldtechs}

We typically hire 1-2 summer field technicians to help us collect data from ongoing projects in Colorado (plant population responses to climate change) and/or Michigan (microbial food webs in *Sarracenia* pitcher plants). Advertisements for these openings will be posted here, on ECOLOG, and via the [lab Twitter account](https://twitter.com/parameterizeit) in January for fieldwork occurring from June through August. These are great opportunities for nearly- or recently-graduated undergraduate students thinking about graduate school in ecology or work in the environmental sciences. These positions are paid at a competitive hourly rate, plus travel to/from the field station and on-site housing.


### Academic visitors {#visitors}

We welcome visiting academics at all stages who want to work on a project with us. Typically this will require you acquire your own funding or work with us on a joint proposal via your home lab/institution, a [Fulbright Commission](https://eca.state.gov/fulbright/about-fulbright/funding-and-administration/fulbright-commissions), or a national science funding agency. Please [email Dr. Petry](#contact) and include a brief description of the project, the ideal start date and duration of your visit, and information about the funding you have or are seeking.
