We work at the interface of experiments, mathematical models, and theory to answer questions about the maintenance of species diversity, ecological forecasting, and population dynamics, mostly in plant and protozoan study systems. Our work encompasses a broad range of study systems and methodological approaches, all of which is anchored in the common goal of understanding the biodiversity in changing environments. If these topics inspire you too, we hope you'll consider joining us. We especially welcome applicants from marginalized and excluded groups as we work to transform ecology into a more equitable and inclusive science.

### Graduate students
Our Department offers two programs for graduate students (Masters & Ph.D.): [Plant Biology](https://cals.ncsu.edu/plant-and-microbial-biology/students/graduate/pb-grad-homepage/) and [Microbiology](https://cals.ncsu.edu/plant-and-microbial-biology/students/graduate/mb-grad-programs/). If neither of these fits, we're fortunate to be able to accept students through other programs on campus as well.

Prospective graduate students should [email me](#contact) in the fall with a paragraph outlining their motivation and preparedness for graduate study as well as their specific interests in our group's research (as well as other groups at NCSU, if relevant). Please also include a CV (advice [here](https://wordvice.com/how-to-write-a-flawless-cv-curriculum-vitae-for-graduate-school/) and [here](https://www.prepscholar.com/gre/blog/how-to-write-a-cv-for-graduate-school/)) and the contact information for two (2) professional references.

We also welcome visiting graduate students who want to work on a chapter with us. Please follow the same instructions as above for prospective graduate students (one of the references should be your current adviser).

### Postdocs
Prospective postdocs should have a relevant research background, demonstrated publication record, and clear motivation for why they'd like to join the lab. There are two mechanisms through which this can happen:

- **Advertised positions:** these are usually funded through an *existing* project and are posted broadly on ECOLOG, Twitter, and similar venues [(why we advertise)](https://www.chronicle.com/article/how-the-opaque-way-we-hire-postdocs-contributes-to-sciences-diversity-problem/)
- **Fellowships:** these are initiated by the prospective postdoc, based on a collaboratively-developed application to a specific fellowship competition

We're especially keen to have postdocs join the group whose expertise *synergizes* with ours, enabling us to collaboratively answer questions that neither of us could have done solo. We mean this broadlyâ€”-inclusive of opportunities to bridge divides between (sub)disciplines or the fundamental and applied axes of ecology.

For advertised positions, specific application instructions will be included in the post. Postdoctoral candidates interested in seeking their own fellowship funding should [email me](#contact) well in advance of the application deadline with (i) a brief summary of their research background and interests, (ii) a 'pitch' of their project idea, and (iii) a curriculum vitae (CV).

### Undergraduate students
Participating in undergraduate research is an unparalleled way to engage in the scientific discovery process and explore the possibility of a career in research. We regularly have openings **during the academic year** to assist with research projects for course credit, work study, or pay ([more here](https://undergradresearch.dasa.ncsu.edu/getting-started/)). Interested undergraduates should [email me](#contact) with a paragraph outlining their motivation and preparedness for research (e.g., relevant coursework).

We also have undergraduate research opportunities **during the summer** to engage in field research in the Rocky Mountains and in northern Michigan. These include educational programs for course credit, fully-funded & paid independent research through the NSF-REU program, and seasonal technician jobs (see below). Interested students should contact me **no later than January 15th** to discuss these opportunities.

### Seasonal field technicians
We typically hire 1-2 summer field technicians to help us collect data from ongoing projects in Colorado (plant population responses to climate change) and/or Michigan (microbial food webs in *Sarracenia* pitcher plants). Advertisements for these openings will be posted here, on ECOLOG, and via the lab Twitter account around December/January for fieldwork June-August. These are great opportunities for nearly- or recently-graduated undergraduate students thinking about graduate school in ecology or work in the environmental sciences. These positions are paid a competitive hourly rate, and travel to/from the field station as well as housing is covered.
