We work at the interface of experiments, mathematical models, and theory to answer questions about the maintenance of species diversity, ecological forecasting, and population dynamics, mostly in plant and protozoan study systems. Our work encompasses a broad range of study systems and methodological approaches, all of which is anchored in the common goal of understanding the biodiversity in changing environments. If these topics inspire you too, we hope you'll consider joining us. We especially welcome applicants from marginalized and excluded groups as we work to transform ecology into a more equitable and inclusive science.

### Graduate students {#gradstudents}

Our Department offers two programs for graduate students (Masters & Ph.D.): [Plant Biology](https://cals.ncsu.edu/plant-and-microbial-biology/students/graduate/pb-grad-homepage/) and [Microbiology](https://cals.ncsu.edu/plant-and-microbial-biology/students/graduate/mb-grad-programs/). If neither of these fits, we're fortunate to be able to accept students through [other programs](https://grad.ncsu.edu/programs/) on campus as well.

Applying to graduate programs is *very* different from applying to undergraduate programs. These differences are especially strong in ecology & evolutionary biology in the USA, where student usually apply to a particular adviser's lab (vs. general admission into a school/degree program). Understanding the process is key component of a successful application, and the following resources offer a good starting place:

- [How-to guide](https://www.mordecailab.com/news-marquee/applying-for-grad-school) compiled by Erin Mordecai's lab.
- [A high-level overview of the application process](https://ssecommunityblog.org/applying-to-a-phd-program-in-the-us-as-an-international-student/). This piece does a nice job plainly stating the 'assumed knowledge' of the US system from the perspectve of an international student (but useful/relevant to all).
- [NCSU's resources](https://grad.ncsu.edu/students/international-students/) for international applicants & graduate students.

Prospective graduate students should [email me](#contact) well in advance of the fall application deadline with:

1. A short paragraph outlining your motivation and preparedness for pursuing graduate study. What do you want to get out of grad school? How has your previous study/experience prepared you?[^1]
2. A short paragraph describing your specific interests in our group's research and what questions you would want to answer with your research. If considering co-advising, please say so and identify the other lab(s) at NCSU that you are considering.
3. Your current CV (see advice [here](https://wordvice.com/how-to-write-a-flawless-cv-curriculum-vitae-for-graduate-school/) and [here](https://www.prepscholar.com/gre/blog/how-to-write-a-cv-for-graduate-school/)).
4. (Optional at thi stage) The names & email addresses for **two** professional references who have agreed to write you [a strong letter of recommendation](https://graduateschoolsite.com/letter-of-recommendation-for-graduate-school/).

Please do not send GRE scores. I do not consider them when evaluating applicants, nor do the primary programs through which I accept students.

We also welcome **visiting graduate students** who want to work on a project with us. Typically this will require you to bring your own funding, which may be available through your home lab/institution or national science funding agency. Please follow the same instructions as above for prospective graduate students and include some information on the specific project you would like to pursue and the funding you have or are seeking. One of your references should be your current adviser.

[^1]: Changing fields? A record ecology-focused study and research experience can help, but isn't necessary. Some great ecologists started off in totally different disciplines. Just be sure to explain why you want to become an ecologist, and think creatively about how the skills you've gained in your discipline can transfer to ecology.

### Postdocs {#postdocs}

Prospective postdocs should have a relevant research background, demonstrated publication record, and clear motivation for why they'd like to join the lab. There are three mechanisms through which this can happen:

- **Advertised positions:** these are usually funded through an *existing* grant and will be announced broadly via ECOLOG, Twitter, and similar venues ([why we advertise](https://www.chronicle.com/article/how-the-opaque-way-we-hire-postdocs-contributes-to-sciences-diversity-problem/))
- **Fellowships:** these are initiated by the prospective postdoc, based on a collaboratively-developed application to a specific fellowship competition (several lists of eco/evo postdoc fellowships are available, e.g., [here](http://biologypostdocs.weebly.com/north-america.html), [here](http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/baskett/links/academia.html#Postdoc), &  [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cHkWrbvNrRdhJL9Z8ucgBZ2HSts2GPA_yozbQPl_x_8/edit#gid=0))
- **Grants** *(atypical)***:** these are the same federally-funded research grants with support for a postdoc position as the advertised position, but are written collaboratively with the postdoc that would fill the position

We're especially keen to have postdocs join the group whose expertise *complements* ours, enabling us to collaboratively answer new questions that neither of us could have done alone. We view complementarity broadly--inclusive of bridges between (sub)disciplines, between fundamental and applied ecology, and between academia and industry/government/NGOs.

For advertised positions, specific application instructions will be included in the post. Postdoctoral candidates interested in seeking their own fellowship funding should [email me](#contact) well in advance of the application deadline with (*i*) a brief summary of their research background and interests, (*ii*) a 'pitch' of their project idea, and (*iii*) a CV.

### Undergraduate students {#undergrads}

Participating in undergraduate research is an unparalleled way to engage in the scientific discovery process and explore the possibility of a career in research. We anticipate regular openings **during the academic year** to assist with research projects for course credit, fulfillment of a degree requirement, work study, or pay ([more here](https://undergradresearch.dasa.ncsu.edu/getting-started/)). Interested undergraduates should [email me](#contact) with a paragraph outlining their motivation and preparedness for research (e.g., relevant coursework or previous research experience).

We also may have opportunities **during the summer** to engage in field research in the [Rocky Mountains](https://www.rmbl.org/students/undergraduates-beyond/summer-education-programreu/) and in [northern Michigan](https://lsa.umich.edu/umbs/students.html). These include educational programs for course credit, fully-funded & paid independent research through the NSF-REU program, and seasonal technician jobs (see below). Interested students may contact me at anytime to discuss these opportunities, but should do so **no later than January 15th** if applying for an NSF-REU (application deadlines are usually in February).

### Seasonal field technicians {#fieldtechs}

We typically hire 1-2 summer field technicians to help us collect data from ongoing projects in Colorado (plant population responses to climate change) and/or Michigan (microbial food webs in *Sarracenia* pitcher plants). Advertisements for these openings will be posted here, on ECOLOG, and via the [lab Twitter account](https://twitter.com/parameterizeit) in January for fieldwork occurring from June through August. These are great opportunities for nearly- or recently-graduated undergraduate students thinking about graduate school in ecology or work in the environmental sciences. These positions are paid at a competitive hourly rate, plus travel to/from the field station and on-site housing.
