We work at the interface of experiments, mathematical models, and theory to answer questions about the maintenance of species diversity, ecological forecasting, and population dynamics, mostly in plant and protozoan study systems. Our work encompasses a broad range of study systems and methodological approaches, all of which is anchored in the common goal of understanding the biodiversity in changing environments. If these topics inspire you too, we hope you'll consider joining us. We especially welcome applicants from marginalized and excluded groups as we work to transform ecology into a more equitable and inclusive science.

### Graduate students

Our Department offers two programs for graduate students (Masters & Ph.D.): [Plant Biology](https://cals.ncsu.edu/plant-and-microbial-biology/students/graduate/pb-grad-homepage/) and [Microbiology](https://cals.ncsu.edu/plant-and-microbial-biology/students/graduate/mb-grad-programs/). If neither of these fits, we're fortunate to be able to accept students through [other programs](https://grad.ncsu.edu/programs/) on campus as well.

Applying to graduate programs is very different from applying to undergraduate programs. These differences are especially strong in ecology & evolutionary biology in the USA. I recommend the following resources:

- [A high-level overview of the application process](https://ssecommunityblog.org/applying-to-a-phd-program-in-the-us-as-an-international-student/). This piece is aimed towards international students, but in so doing does a nice job plainly stating information that is often 'assumed knowledge.'
- [NCSU's resources](https://grad.ncsu.edu/students/international-students/) for international applicants & graduate students.
- [How-to guide](https://www.mordecailab.com/news-marquee/applying-for-grad-school) from Erin Mordecai's lab.

Prospective graduate students should [email me](#contact) in the fall with:

1. a short paragraph outlining your motivation and preparedness for graduate study
2. a short paragraph describing your specific interests in our group's research (as well as other groups at NCSU, if relevant)
3. your current CV (see advice [here](https://wordvice.com/how-to-write-a-flawless-cv-curriculum-vitae-for-graduate-school/) and [here](https://www.prepscholar.com/gre/blog/how-to-write-a-cv-for-graduate-school/))
4. the names & email addresses for **two** professional references who have agreed to write you [a strong letter of recommendation](https://graduateschoolsite.com/letter-of-recommendation-for-graduate-school/)

Please do not send GRE scores. I do not ask for them nor consider them when evaluating applicants, nor do the primary programs through which I accept students.

We also welcome **visiting graduate students** who want to work on a project with us. Typically this will require you to bring your own funding, which may be available through your home lab/institution or national science funding agency. Please follow the same instructions as above for prospective graduate students and include some information on the funding you have or are seeking. One of your references should be your current adviser.

### Postdocs

Prospective postdocs should have a relevant research background, demonstrated publication record, and clear motivation for why they'd like to join the lab. There are two mechanisms through which this can happen:

- **Advertised positions:** these are usually funded through an *existing* project and are posted broadly on ECOLOG, Twitter, and similar venues [(why we advertise)](https://www.chronicle.com/article/how-the-opaque-way-we-hire-postdocs-contributes-to-sciences-diversity-problem/)
- **Fellowships:** these are initiated by the prospective postdoc, based on a collaboratively-developed application to a specific fellowship competition

We're especially keen to have postdocs join the group whose expertise *synergizes* with ours, enabling us to collaboratively answer questions that neither of us could have done solo. We mean this broadly--inclusive of opportunities to bridge divides between (sub)disciplines or the fundamental and applied axes of ecology.

For advertised positions, specific application instructions will be included in the post. Postdoctoral candidates interested in seeking their own fellowship funding should [email me](#contact) well in advance of the application deadline with (i) a brief summary of their research background and interests, (ii) a 'pitch' of their project idea, and (iii) a curriculum vitae (CV).

### Undergraduate students

Participating in undergraduate research is an unparalleled way to engage in the scientific discovery process and explore the possibility of a career in research. We regularly have openings **during the academic year** to assist with research projects for course credit, fulfillment of a degree requirement, work study, or pay ([more here](https://undergradresearch.dasa.ncsu.edu/getting-started/)). Interested undergraduates should [email me](#contact) with a paragraph outlining their motivation and preparedness for research (e.g., relevant coursework or previous research experience).

We also may have opportunities **during the summer** to engage in field research in the [Rocky Mountains](https://www.rmbl.org/students/undergraduates-beyond/summer-education-programreu/) and in [northern Michigan](https://lsa.umich.edu/umbs/students.html). These include educational programs for course credit, fully-funded & paid independent research through the NSF-REU program, and seasonal technician jobs (see below). Interested students may contact me at anytime to discuss these opportunities, but should do so **no later than January 15th** if applying for an NSF-REU (application deadlines are usually in February).

### Seasonal field technicians

We typically hire 1-2 summer field technicians to help us collect data from ongoing projects in Colorado (plant population responses to climate change) and/or Michigan (microbial food webs in *Sarracenia* pitcher plants). Advertisements for these openings will be posted here, on ECOLOG, and via the [lab Twitter account](https://twitter.com/parameterizeit) in December/January for fieldwork occurring from June through August. These are great opportunities for nearly- or recently-graduated undergraduate students thinking about graduate school in ecology or work in the environmental sciences. These positions are paid at a competitive hourly rate, plus travel to/from the field station and on-site housing.
