Ewa finished her Masters degree in Environmental Science at ETH Zurich. Her thesis focused on how the functional diversity of annual plant seeds shaped granivore foraging preferences and landscape-level species distributions, and it was recognized as one of the top 10% Masters theses. Ewa is now doing her Ph.D. at Eawag and the University of Zurich, where she's working on the community dynamics of phytoplankton in lakes.
