Lucy was a student in the Rocky Mountain Biological Lab's summer undergraduate research program, where she worked (remotely, due to Covid-19) on forecasting *Valeriana edulis* population sex ratios. Since working with us, she finished her Bachelor's degree at Durham University (UK) and has started a Masters program in international environmental policy at Duke Kunshan University (China).
